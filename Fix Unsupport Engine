The "unsupported engine" error typically occurs when you try to install an npm package, and the version of Node.js you are using does not meet the version requirements specified by the package. In this case, it's likely that the packages (`express`, `mongoose`, `nanoid`) you are trying to install require a newer or specific version of Node.js that your system does not meet.

### Steps to Fix the Unsupported Engine Error

#### 1. **Check Your Node.js Version**
First, check your current Node.js version:

```bash
node -v
```

Compare this with the required version for the packages (`express`, `mongoose`, `nanoid`). For example, many modern packages require Node.js version 12 or later, and some might require Node.js 16 or newer.

#### 2. **Update Node.js to the Latest LTS Version**

You can update your Node.js version to the latest **LTS (Long Term Support)** version using NodeSource or `nvm` (Node Version Manager). Here are two methods for updating Node.js on Ubuntu:

##### Method 1: Using NodeSource (Recommended for Server Environments)

1. Remove the existing Node.js version (if necessary):

   ```bash
   sudo apt remove nodejs
   ```

2. Install the latest Node.js LTS version (as of 2024, Node.js 18.x is the latest LTS):

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt install -y nodejs
   ```

3. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

   This should show the updated version, e.g., `v18.x.x`.

##### Method 2: Using `nvm` (Node Version Manager)

If you prefer managing multiple Node.js versions (e.g., for development purposes), you can use `nvm`.

1. Install `nvm`:

   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Install the latest LTS version of Node.js:

   ```bash
   nvm install --lts
   ```

3. Set the default Node.js version:

   ```bash
   nvm use --lts
   ```

4. Verify the Node.js version:

   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

   This should show the updated version, e.g., `v18.x.x`.

#### 3. **Reinstall the Packages**
Once your Node.js version is updated, try installing the packages again:

```bash
npm install express mongoose nanoid
```

This should work without the "unsupported engine" error now.

### Why This Happens

Each npm package often specifies the minimum required version of Node.js in its `package.json` file under the `engines` field. For example, a `package.json` might include:

```json
"engines": {
  "node": ">= 12.0.0"
}
```

If your version of Node.js does not meet this requirement, npm will throw an "unsupported engine" error.
