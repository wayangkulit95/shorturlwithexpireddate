The `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` error occurs when you try to import or require a module that is written as an ES module (ESM), but you're using CommonJS (the default module system in Node.js). This error typically means that the module you’re trying to use is written as an ES module and requires Node.js to load it using the `import` statement, rather than the `require` function.

### Why This Happens
- **CommonJS vs ESM**: In Node.js, there are two module systems:
  - **CommonJS (CJS)**: This is the older system, which uses `require()` to import modules and `module.exports` to export them.
  - **ECMAScript Modules (ESM)**: This is the newer system, which uses `import` and `export` statements.

If a module is defined as an ES module, you need to use `import` instead of `require`.

### How to Fix `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM`

#### 1. **Use `import` Instead of `require`**

If you're trying to load a module that requires ESM (like certain newer versions of `nanoid`), you must use the `import` syntax.

To convert your code to use `import`, first, make sure that your project is set up for ESM.

##### a. **Change Your File Extension to `.mjs`** (Optional)

One option is to rename your `server.js` file to `server.mjs`. This tells Node.js to treat the file as an ES module automatically.

```bash
mv server.js server.mjs
```

Now, in `server.mjs`, use `import` instead of `require`:

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
import { nanoid } from 'nanoid';
```

After this change, you should be able to run:

```bash
node server.mjs
```

##### b. **Update `package.json` to Use ES Modules**

If you don't want to rename your file to `.mjs`, you can instruct Node.js to treat your entire project as an ES module by adding the `"type": "module"` field to your `package.json`.

1. Open your `package.json` file and add the following:

   ```json
   {
     "type": "module"
   }
   ```

2. In your `server.js`, replace `require` with `import`:

   ```javascript
   import express from 'express';
   import mongoose from 'mongoose';
   import { nanoid } from 'nanoid';
   ```

3. Now run your project:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

#### 2. **Use `require` in CommonJS Mode (If Possible)**

If you're using a version of the `nanoid` module or other libraries that only support ESM, but you still want to use CommonJS (`require`), you'll need to ensure that all modules are compatible with CommonJS. If `nanoid` or any other module is forcing ESM, you’ll have to either:

- **Downgrade to a version that supports CommonJS**.

For example, with `nanoid`, versions before `3.x` were written in CommonJS. You can downgrade:

```bash
npm install nanoid@2.1.11
```

Then you can keep using:

```javascript
const { nanoid } = require('nanoid');
```

#### 3. **Use Dynamic `import()` as a Workaround**

If you need to keep using `require` but want to load an ESM module dynamically, you can use the `import()` function, which is supported in CommonJS files.

Example:

```javascript
(async () => {
    const express = await import('express');
    const mongoose = await import('mongoose');
    const { nanoid } = await import('nanoid');
    
    // Your express app code here...
})();
```

This approach allows you to use `import` in an asynchronous context while keeping your module in CommonJS.

---

### Summary of Solutions:
1. **Switch to ES modules** by using `import` and changing your file to `.mjs` or adding `"type": "module"` in your `package.json`.
2. **Downgrade the package** to a version that still supports CommonJS.
3. **Use dynamic imports** with `import()` if you're sticking with CommonJS.

One of these options should solve your `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` error! Let me know which one works for you or if you need further clarification.
